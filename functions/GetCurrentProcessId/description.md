# GetCurrentProcessId

## Implementation Details

This function retrieves the current process ID by directly accessing the Thread Environment Block (TEB) of the running thread, bypassing the standard Windows API. The TEB contains a 'CLIENT_ID' structure, which holds the process and thread identifiers for the current thread.

Steps:
1. Access the current threadsâ€™s TEB.
2. Access the 'ClientId' field of the TEB..
3. Extract the 'UniqueProcess' member, which is a pointer-sized field representing the process ID.
4. Cast the 'void*' value to 'uintptr_t' and then to 'DWORD', since process IDs are 32-bit values on Windows.

## Limitations

- Only tested and guaranteed to work on Windows 11 version 23H2 (x64). Internal structures may differ in other builds or architectures.
- Assumes that 'ClientId.UniqueProcess' stores the process ID as a pointer-sized integer, which is true for modern Windows NT-based systems.
